# Solid Budget

Based off the same principles as [Budget Dash](http://github.com/kjintroverted/budget-dash), this is a budgeting tool designed to help you understand where your money is allocated and going on a monthly or yearly basis. The idea is to make sure every dollar has a job and that you know what those jobs are to better plan your finances.
